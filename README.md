Simple tutorials on some frequently used tools in daily research.

> TensorBoard
  
TensorBoard is a visualization toolkit for machine learning experimentation. TensorBoard allows tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph, viewing histograms, displaying images and much more.

> Aim
